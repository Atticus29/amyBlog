      <h2> How a california girl became a cupcake maker/feline lover</h2>
      <p> Amy was born in San Francisco, CA. She knew she had a special connection to cats at a very young age. <br>Even now, if you ask the neighbors what that strange meowing sound is, they are bound to answer, "It's probably Amy!" <br>Amy is a cupcake baker that has appeared on world renown shows like, "Kitchen Nightmares,"COPS,"and "How to Catch a Predator." <br>She loves spending time at the local animal shelter, often spending hours singing to the kittens. Here we can observe her in her natural habitat.

        Hello, readers! Today, Amy's Baking Company joyfully unveiled our newest flavor, dirt pudding (now with actual worms!). I'm still working on the name. Unfortunately, there were no early birds (HAHA!), and, upon closing, I realized with disappointment that not a single cupcake was snatched up. Sigh. Well, at least Whiskers will have an extra treat after her salmon dinner tonight. Note to self: catnip as a cupcake garnish!

        Hi again! That Gordon Ramsey is such a horrible person! He ruined our reputation ON NATIONAL TELEVISION! Those customers were THE WORST! If he hadn't left, I would have removed him myself. His advice was NOT HELPFUL! And he's not even a good chef! Some people like raw dough on their pizza! Ugh!<br>
        I took Frisky to the vet today. Again. Gall stones this time. The vet told me to stop feeding him our pizza. He's a quack, and I'll take my pet and my money elsewhere. Gosh! Why can't I find a reliable vet in this town? This is our seventh in two years!
